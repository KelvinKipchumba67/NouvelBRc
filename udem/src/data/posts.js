    title: "Why 'Dune' is Better in a Group",
    author: "Sarah Jenkins",
    date: "March 15, 2024",
    category: "Discussion",

    excerpt: "Frank Herbert's masterpiece is dense, political, and philosophical. Here is why tackling Arrakis with friends makes the journey easier.",

      Reading 'Dune' alone can feel like wandering the desert without a stillsuit. The political intrigue, the Bene Gesserit schemes, and the ecological details are overwhelming.
      
      When we read it as a group, however, magic happened. One member tracked the ecology, another mapped the political houses, and suddenly Arrakis came alive. 
      
      We found that discussing the ethics of Paul Atreides' rise to power led to one of our most heated and engaging sessions yet. If you've been intimidated by this 800-page giant, join us. We promise the spice is worth it.

    excerpt: "We sat down with the author of 'The Martian' and 'Project Hail Mary' to discuss science, space, and his writing process.",
    content: `
      Andy Weir is known for his relentless commitment to scientific accuracy. In our exclusive interview, he revealed that he wrote software to calculate orbital trajectories just for a few throwaway lines in 'Project Hail Mary'.
      
      "I want the reader to trust me," Weir said. "If I get the math right, they'll follow me anywhere."
      
      We also discussed his favorite book (it's not sci-fi!) and what he thinks about the upcoming movie adaptations of his work.

    title: "The Rise of 'Romantasy'",
    author: "Alex Rivera",
    date: "February 28, 2024",
    category: "Trends",

    excerpt: "Dragons, magic, and... slow-burn romance? Why the blend of Fantasy and Romance is taking over the bestseller lists.",
    content: `
      If you've walked into a bookstore lately, you've likely seen tables stacked high with books featuring swords on the cover—but also flowers. This is 'Romantasy,' the genre blending high-stakes fantasy world-building with the emotional core of a romance novel.
      
      Authors like Sarah J. Maas and Rebecca Yarros have brought this niche into the mainstream. But why now? Readers tell us they love the escapism of fantasy but crave the character-driven relationships of romance.
      
      We are dedicating next month's meetup to this genre. Bring your favorite wing-leader or fae prince recommendations!

    excerpt: "I spent 48 hours with no phone, no laptop, and no TV. Just me, a stack of books, and a lot of tea. Here is what happened.",
    content: `
      In an age of constant notifications, true silence is rare. Last weekend, I locked my phone in a drawer on Friday night and didn't touch it until Monday morning.
      
      The first few hours were anxious. I kept reaching for a phantom pocket to check Instagram. But by Saturday afternoon, something shifted. My reading speed doubled. I finished an entire novel in one sitting—something I haven't done since I was a teenager.
      
      The 'Introvert Happy Hour' philosophy isn't just about being quiet; it's about reclaiming your attention span. I highly recommend trying a mini-detox this weekend. Your brain (and your "To Be Read" pile) will thank you.
